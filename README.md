# checkpyConnectFour

Source code for ConnectFour in test folder. Is used to get functions to run simulation against user function.
The source code is currently mirrored in ConnectFour.py for testing purposes (only difference is the computer move function is renamed to make_move()).
Test does not seem to work currently, might be a threading issue related to having functionas and variables outside the actual test functions (decorated).
